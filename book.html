            It‚Äôs incredible to think how just a few months ago, I didn‚Äôt even know
            who you were and yet there was a connection between us we couldnt ignore . Meeting you through Purp was a chance I‚Äôm
            forever grateful for. In the beginning, I wasn‚Äôt sure how we would
            connect, how we‚Äôd talk, or how you‚Äôd be since you always went offline and we didnt talk much and you were sick too. But after clearing our misunderstandings and talking to each other , i come to realize that youre absolutely the most loveavble woman in the planet that 
            is willing to get hurt and heal me every single time . you are my rock, my safe haven, my best friend, my soulmate, my everything. I love you .

            Talking to you has quickly become one of my favorite parts of the
            day. Every time I see a message from you, I can't help but smile. It
            feels like my day instantly gets brighter just because of our
            conversation. You're not just great to look at; your personality
            makes you even more special.
